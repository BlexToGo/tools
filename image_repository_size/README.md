# image_repository_size
This is a smal bash script which uses crane to calculate the total size of all tagged images of an image repository.
This was useful to anticipate the migration effort from Docker Hub to another image registry after [Docker's announcement](https://web.docker.com/rs/790-SSB-375/images/privatereposfaq.pdf) in March of 2023.
